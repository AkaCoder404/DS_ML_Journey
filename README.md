# Data Science and Machine Learning
This is a portfolio for my data science and machine learning journey. It contains notes, courses. This contains mainly code/project based nodes. My other notes can be found at my second brain here.

## Repository
```bash
01_MOOCS/        # Online courses taken from Coursera, Udacity, Datacamp, etc
02_Case_Studies/ # Utilizing data science, engineering, analyst, machine learning, to solve problems (Kaggle, etc.)
03_Machine_Learning/ # PyTorch, ANN, CNN, 
04_SQL/             # Working with and learning SQL
05_Projects/        # Personal projects that are unclassified
```

## Portfolio Projects


## Mini-Projects
1. Real-Time Object Traffic Data with [Faster-CNN](/05_Pytorch/02_FasterRCNN_ResNetFPN.ipynb), [YOLOv5](/05_Projects/YOLOv5/01_)
2. Recreating CNN Architectures and Testing them on ImageNet can be found [here](./30_Machine_Learning/03_Recreating_CNN_Models/)

## TODO
- Publish notes that I have taken somewhere
